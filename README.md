# gpt-resolve
Can GPT solve Brazilian university entrance exams?

This project is an implementation of how to use LLMs to solve challenging Brazilian university entrance exams.

We'll use `o1-preview`, which is the best OpenAI model so far with reasoning capabilities, and `gpt-4o` to describe the exam images so that `o1-preview` can solve them on question at a time (as it does not have image capabilities yet). Results are saved as txt files with LaTeX formatting, and you can optionally convert them to a nice PDF with this package or using some LaTeX editor.

The project begins with the ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica) 2025 exam, focusing first on the Math essay section. This section, from the recent exam on November 5, 2024, demands deep subject understanding and step-by-step solutions. More details are in the [report](exams/ita_2025/report.md) documentation. 

**Spoiler: o1-preview scored 90% in the ITA 2025 Math Essay Exam, 95% in Chemistry Essay and only 65% in Physics Essay.**

After the first ITA 2025 exam is fully solved, the project will try to expand to other sections and eventually other exams. Feel free to contribute with ideas and implementations of other exams!

# Installation and How to use
gpt-resolve is distributed in pypi:
```bash
pip install gpt-resolve
```

`gpt-resolve` provides a simple CLI with two main commands: `resolve` for solving exam questions and `compile-solutions` for generating PDFs from the solutions:

### Solve exams with `resolve`

To generate solutions for an exam:
- save the exam images in the exam folder `exam_path`, one question per image file. File names should follow the pattern `q<question_number>.jpg`, e.g. `q1.jpg`, `q2.jpg`, etc.
- add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your global environment variables or to a `.env` file in the current directory

then, run
```bash
gpt-resolve resolve -p exam_path
```
and grab a coffee while it runs.

If you want to test the process without making real API calls, you can use the `--dry-run` flag. See `gpt-resolve resolve --help` for more details about solving only a subset of questions or controlling token usage.


### Compile solutions with `compile-solutions`

Once you have the solutions in your exam folder `exam_path`, you can compile them into a single PDF running:
```bash
gpt-resolve compile-solutions -p exam_path --title "Your Exam Title"
```

For that command to work, you'll need a LaTeX distribution in your system. See some guidelines [here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (MacTeX for MacOS was used to start this project).

# Troubleshooting

Sometimes, it was observed that the output from `o1-preview` produced invalid LaTeX code when nesting display math environments (such as `\[...\]` and `\begin{align*} ... \end{align*}` together). The current prompt for `o1-preview` adds an instruction to avoid this, which works most of the time. If that happens, you can try to solve the question again by running `gpt-resolve resolve -p exam_path -q <question_number>`, or making more adjustments to the prompt, or fixing the output LaTeX code manually.

# Costs

The `o1-preview` model is so far [available only for Tiers 3, 4 and 5](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9824962-openai-o1-preview-and-o1-mini-usage-limits-on-chatgpt-and-the-api). It is [6x more expensive](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) than `gpt-4o`, and also consumes much more tokens to "reason" (see more [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning/controlling-costs#controlling-costs)), so be mindful about the number of questions you are solving and how many max tokens you're allowing gpt-resolve to use (see `gpt-resolve resolve --help` to control `max-tokens-question-answer`, which drives the cost). You can roughly estimate an upper bound for costs of solving an exam by 
```
(number of questions) * (max_tokens_question_answer / 1_000_000) * (price per 1M tokens)
```
For the current price for o1-preview of $15/$60 per 1M tokens for input/output tokens, an 10 question exam with 10000 max tokens per question would cost less than $6.
