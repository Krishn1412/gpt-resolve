## Comments

`o1-preview` almost got all questions correct in the Math essay exam. The only question it got wrong was question 10, which is a question about spacial geometry, which is a known area of weakness for LLMs. After running that question several times, it can get it correct sometimes, but not always. Since it did not got it correct in the first try, it was considered wrong. Check one of these correct answers [here](exams/ita_2025/math/essays/solutions/q10_solution_rerun.txt).
